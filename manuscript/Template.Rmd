Put all the files related to a single project in a designated folder. Depending on project complexity, you might enforce further organization into subfolders.

Isolate each computationally demanding step in its own script and write the precious object to file with saveRDS(my_precious, here("results", "my_precious.rds")). Now you can develop scripts to do downstream work that reload the precious object via my_precious <- readRDS(here("results", "my_precious.rds")). Breaking an analysis i
 
# Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.



# Methods
```{r results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
#this creates a paragraph of citations
grateful::cite_packages(output = "paragraph", cite.tidyverse = TRUE)

```

# Results

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Tips
Clean out your workspace and restart R and re-run everything periodically, if things get weird.

Keep things machine- and human-readable, whenever possible.



```{r, eval=TRUE}
## insert your brilliant WORKING code here
```
